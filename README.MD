# Tsundoku
A Google Books Reader Application for Android 5.0+

## Description:
This is a practice app for the ["Android Basics: Networking"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud843) course on Udacity.

Initial functionality is simple: Enter a search term to retrieve a list of books from the Google Books API.
The results will be displayed in a scrollable list that shows book title, author, and a thumbnail of the cover.

Extra features might be added once basic functionality is granted.

## Purpose:
This app is built to show a grasp of the following basic elements in creating a mobile application for Android:

- JSON Parsing
- HTTP Networking
- Threads & Parallelism
- Custom Adapters

### Additional notes:
The term _Tsundoku_ refers to the Japanese term "_積読_", which translates to "collecting books without reading them".
